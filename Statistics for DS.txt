Stat is scientific approach to do data analysis and predictions.

In stat, predictions based on experience (i.e. no proof) is called hypothesis

Correlation value: relation between 2 factors used to calculate +ve or -ve dependencies.
positive dependency: as one increases, other will also increases. ex, if temperature increases, sale of cold drink increases.
negative dependency: as one increase, other will decrease.ex, if temperature decreases, sale of sweaters increase.

TO understand dependency between 2 variables, correlation proof can be used.
Where correlation is estimated by correlation efficient (depicted as "r")
r value will always be between -1 to +1 where 
a) if "r" is 0, there is no dependecy between variables.
b) if "r" is > 0, then positive dependency i.e. both variables flow in same directtion. ex corr(temperature, cold drink sales) = 0.8
c) if "r" is < 0, then negative dependency i.e. both variables flow in opposite direction. ex corr(temperature, sweater sales) = -0.78

Stat analyisis is subclassified as:
1) Descriptive stat: getting better sense of data i.e. describing data. ex, mean, median, mode
					 i.e. collect data, Present data, Summarize data. So we analyze over the entire data for a question
					and then come to conclusion.
2) Inferential stat: drawing conclusion abt something (ex, population) based on sample data.eg: probability.
					 i.e. we analyze over sample data and then come to conclusion.
					example, if we want to know the avg weight of females (age 20-35) in Pune, it will not be a wise choice to 
					collect entire data for entire population.
					Solution will be to collect sample. This process of collecting sample is "Sampling"
					example, collect sample for about 500 females and then apply avg on weight.
					based on this data conclude on entire population.
					When doing Inferencial stats, "confidence Interval" (CI) i.e. the %confidence that data is correct.
					ex,
					"the avg age of females (20-35) is 85 kg with 0.05 CI"
					CI (how it is calculated),this test should be done before coming to conclusion,
					if CI = 0.05
					confidence on data is (1 - CI) i.e. 1 - 0.05 = 0.95 => 95%
					In general, if data is increasing, CI should also increase.
				
					When collecting sample, usually Sampling bias happens, i.e. different people have different interpretations
					for same data.
					
					
Statistical analysis can be divided into:
1) Univariate Analysis 	 : Analysis over single variable. 
							ex, runs scored by Sachin T and Saurav G over 100 matches is given, 
							    among Sacin and Ganguly, whose performance is good? 
								as Statistical instrument is mean. i.e. applied on runs of each player 
								
							ex, MCT (measure of central tendency),Despertions, distributions.
2) MultiVariate Analysis : Analysis over multiple variables i.e. combination of variables.	
							ex,runs scored by Sachin T and Saurav G over 100 matches is given,
								what is dependency between 2 players? as Statistical instrument is correlation.
								correlation applies on combination of runs scored by each player. 
								i.e.corr(s,g) = -0.78 (i.e. -ve dependency)
							
							ex, covariance, correlation, linear and non linear regression, logistic regression.
							

Univariate analysis methods,
1) measure of central tendency (MCT): mean , mode, median. Used to explain a variable's performance with a single value.
	MCT however does not include sum, max, min, count because these do not help explain performance of a variable.
	
	following are used in MCT:
	a) Mean: (summing up values/number of data types) i.e. average. It can be used to determine which variables' value is 
			  close to mean. ex, Sachin's avg run is 70 => most of sachin's scores are close to 70.
			  
			  3 types of mean,
			  a) arithmetic mean: (sum of all elements/number of elements) i.e. avg.
					AM can be used wherever decimal is neglectable. 
					ex, if there is a list of weights like [50.25,50.50,49.25,50.75] and we need to determine who among
					these 3 participants is slim, we will concurr all of them are slim as the weights are similar, something
					decimal is not significant here.
					ex 2
			  b) geometric mean: GM is used whenever decimal is important.
					ex, if there is list of weight of gold jewellery like [1.5,1.75,1.25], we cannot ignore the change
					in decimals as each gram will add/deduct considerable money, so GM is used as decimal value is important.
					
					formula : n th root of product of all elements. ex, GM of [10,20,30] = cube root of (10 * 20 * 30)
			  
			  c) harmonic mean: HM is used when there is one or more outliers. HM allows us to neglect the outlier by 
					providing less weightage to outlier.
					Also, when the decimals have to be considered minutely, it is preferrable to use harmonic mean.
					ex, in a tournament, id Sachin's score is following in 4 matches [60,70,80,290], mean will be 125
					i.e. it will imply Sachin performed exceptional in the tournament, but the avg increased just because of score
					of 290 in 1 match (i.e. outlier) thus giving incorrect judgement.
					ex 2, when we are taking weight of chemical composition
					[0.00354678,0.00351111,0.0034999], although, if rounded off to 4 decimals i.e. [0.0035,0.0035,0.0034]
					still there will be considerable difference, so we need to consider decimals minutely.
					
					formula: n/sum of each element inversion => 1/ (1/x + 1/y + ....). ex, HM of [10,20,30]
					will be 1/(1/10 + 1/20 + 1/30) 
		
	b) Mode: most repeated value. ex, if a class has students from following background,[BE, BE,MBA, BE,BE,MCA], then mode is BE.
			 however, if the data is like, in a class of 100 students learning DS,[51 male students and 49 female students], then
			 using mode is not a very good idea to define that males students are preferring DS as career.
			 ex 2, among cancer patients, 
				1) if 100 are non smokers and 900 are smokers, we can say that "smoking cause cancer"
				2) if 501 are non smokers and 499 are smokers, we cannot infer if "smoking causes cancer"
			 
			 Note: Mode is used when the number of choices is less (ex, choice from yes or no).
				   Mode cannot be used when data is variable, in this case we create status (or category)
				   ex,
				   a cricketers score in 10 matches - [90,70,75,0,79,100,50,49,0,45]
				   Mode will be 0, which does not indicate the player's performance in 10 matches.
				   so, we categorize it as,
				   [90,70,75,0,79,100,71,49,0,72] =>  [above, above,above,below,above,above,above,below,below,above]
				   where above is (scores above average) and below is (scores below average)
				   so here mode(player performance) = above, hence cricketer performed well.
				  
	c) Median: sort the data in asc and desc and take exact middle value (called central value). Usually used for comparitive
			   analysis
				example, [10,90,34,6,89,67,12] =>sort [6,10,12,34,67,89,90] => Median is 34 (i,e, 4th value from both ends)
						i.e. 50% of data is less than 34.
					 [10,90,34,6,89,67] => sort [6,10,34,67,89,90] => Median is 50.5 (i.e. (34+67)/2)
					 
				NOTE: We come to median only when mean and mode fetches the same/similar results.
				   
				example, there are 2 cricketers who played 1000 matches.
				C1: median is 60 runs
				C2: median is 80 runs
				implies,
				C1                           			C2
				C1 scored >=60 runs in 500 matches		C2 scored >=80 runs in 500 matches
				-										C2 scored >=60 runs in approx 700 matches (assumptions)
				C1 scored >=80 runs in 300 matches      -
				implies,
				C2 is a better scorer than C1.
				
				if median does not help decide i.e. median is also same/similar, we use QUARTILES (1/4th of data).
				
				there are 3 QUARILES,
				a) Q1: 25% of entire data i.e. 25% of data is less than Q1 and 75% is greater than Q1
				b) Q2: 50% of entire data i.e. 50% of data is less than Q2 and 50% is greater than Q2 i.e.median.
				c) Q3: 75% of entire data i.e. 75% of data is less than Q3 and 25% is greater than Q3.
