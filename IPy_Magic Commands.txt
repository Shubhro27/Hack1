magic commands in IPython (https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/01.03-magic-commands.html):
Magic commands come in two flavors: line magics, which are denoted by a single % prefix and operate on a single line of input, and cell magics, which are denoted by a double %% prefix and operate on multiple lines of input.

NOTE: any run command documentation can be viewed via %<command>? in IPython interpreter i.e. example, %run?

1) paste: used to paste and run a python block of code (copied from web or other editor) and run it.
	Syntax: %paste
	example,
		ipython
		In [3]: %paste
		>>> def donothing(x):
		...     return x

		## -- End pasted text --
		
2) cpaste:  opens up an interactive multiline prompt in which you can paste one or more chunks of code to be executed in a batch. Similar to paste command.
	Syntax: %cpaste
	example,
		ipython
		In [5]: %cpaste
		Pasting code; enter '--' alone on the line to stop or use Ctrl-D.
		:>>> def donothing(x):
		:...     return x
		:--
		
3) run: ipython allows importing modules stored in text file (i.e. .py extention to reuse).In order to run such code in an existing iPython session, we can 
        use %run magic command.
		Syntax: %run <.py>
		example,
			#-------------------------------------
			# file: myscript.py

			def square(x):
				"""square a number"""
				return x ** 2

			for N in range(1, 4):
				print(N, "squared is", square(N))
			#-------------------------------------
		
		 IPython session as follows:
		 ipython
		 In [6]: %run myscript.py
		 
		o/p:
		1 squared is 1
		2 squared is 4
		3 squared is 9
		
4) timeit: this run command is used to determine the execution time of the single-line Python statement that follows it.
	syntax: %timeit <Python statement>
	example,
	ipython
	In [8]: %timeit L = [n ** 2 for n in range(1000)]
	1000 loops, best of 3: 325 µs per loop
	
	For multi line statements, we can run timeit as cell magics command.
	example,
	ipython
	In [9]: %%timeit
	   ...: L = []
	   ...: for n in range(1000):
	   ...:     L.append(n ** 2)
	   ...: 
	1000 loops, best of 3: 373 µs per loop
	
5) magic and lsmagic: IPython magic functions have docstrings.
	for example, to read the documentation of the %timeit magic simply type this:
	ipython
	In [10]: %timeit?
	
	To access a general description of available magic functions, including some examples, you can type this:
	ipython
	In [11]: %magic
	
	For a quick and simple list of all available magic functions, type this:
	ipython
	In [12]: %lsmagic
