Problem with using Tableau, Qlick and Hi-Charts i.e. visualzation tools? 
we will have to connect to these tools, format data, baseline the visualization (i.e. handle any visualization issues)
and all this to support prototyping (i.e. which model is better for a prediction/analysis)

Python came up with Matplotlib and Seaborn are 2 packages which build visualizations seamlessly (and is faster).

Components of a Matplotlib visualization:
1) Figure: window/page where the diagram is drawn
2) Axes: area on which the data is plotted (with Matplotlib functions). Each Axes has a x-axis and y-axis
3) Spines: lines that designate the boundaries of the data area.
4) Subplots: used to set up and place axes on a regular grid.i.e. in case of multiple curves to be designed within the same axes.

Matplotlib has 2 major modules:
1) Pyplot: allows programmer to implicitly create figures and axes to achieve desired plot.
2) Pylab : this imports both (pyplot and numpy libs) and recommended when working with arrays and mathematical functions.

Basic operations:
1) plot() : creates object and outputs info on it. This does not show the figure created.
			If plot() is given only a single array/list,
			a) assumes it is a vector of y-values
			b) Automatically generates a x-vector of same length as Y axis with consecutive integes starting with ZERO.
			
			Plot(x,y) function helps pass both x and y vectors and len(x) == len(y)
			
2) show() : displays figure. 

example-1,
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib as mpl
% matplotlib inline    #this is a magic command, when using Jupyter Notebook, to plot graphs within the notebook
#
cars = pd.read_csv(your_local_path+'cars.csv')
plt.plot(cars.Actual_MPG, color = 'red')   
plt.show

NOTE: In this program, we have just plotted one variable that will form Y-axis. In such cases Python will plot the index of the DF (cars) as the x-axis.

example-2,
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib as mpl

arr = np.linspace(0,15,40) #This will plot 39 eqidistant points between 0 and 15
sin_arr = np.sin(arr)      # will calculate sin of every element in arr
plt.plot(arr,sin_arr)      # x-axis is arr and y-axis is sin_arr

How to convert a number of junk-values into one junk value:

There can be situations when the i/p data (csv,txt) may have junk values in a particular column, which Python, by default, cannot convert into NaN.
example,
roemissing = pd.read_csv('roemissing.csv',na_values = ['NULL',-999,'RP'])   #replace 'NULL',-999,'RP' in any column with NaN 
print roemissing
roemissing = pd.read_csv('roemissing.csv',na_values = {'Number of firms':['NULL',-999],'ROE':['10000.00%']}) #replace NULL,-999 only if visible in 'Number of firms' column

NOTE: 'NULL' will always be implicitely replaced by NaN.

Writing data to csv file,
roedata = pd.read_csv(your_local_path+'roedata.csv')
print(roedata)
roedata.to_csv(your_local_path+'roedatawrite89.csv')

NOTE: the above method will also map indexes to the csv file in a column. In order to avoid mapping indexes, we can use,
roedata.to_csv(your_local_path+'roedatawrite89.csv', index=False, columns=['Industry Name','ROE']) #by default index = True.
