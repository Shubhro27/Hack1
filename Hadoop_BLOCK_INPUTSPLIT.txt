Map Reduce, blocks and input splits:

first thing to know is that blocks are physical storage unit and input splits are logical storage unit.

In ideal scenario (and mostly) Input split size is = block size.

Input split is based on end of line indicators.

In case a particular record size spans over multiple lines, size of input split > block size

block size in cloudera is 128MB, so if a record does not logically end at the last bit of 128MB block size, it may get spilled to the next block.

NOTE:::::::::: block size is physical division taken care by HDFS (and replicated as per replication factor). As this point MR has not started.
               Input splits will be calculated when MR kicks in.
			   
In case, the input split is != block size, the remaining part of the logical record is moved to a consecutive block. 
So when we fire up a MR code, it checks for a good record, so when it hits the end of current block but sees that the record line it is processing has not ended,
it goes to the next block to fetch the remaining part and complete the record line.

NOTE: the number of mappers is equal to the number of input splits.

Input splits are user defined (so the default value can be changed)

Size of the input split is calculated by the following formula:
max[min split size configured for mapred,min(max split size configured for mapred, dfs block size)
example,
if min split defined = 128 MB
if max split defined = 256 MB
block size = 64 MB
so input split size = max[128, min(256,64)] = max[128,64] = 128 MB

if the i/p file is 256 MB
number of blocks = 256/64 = 4
number of mappers = number of input splits = [file size/input split size] = [256/128] = 2

The mapred input split properties are configured in mapred.xml, parameters being:
mapreduce.input.fileinputformat.split.minsize
mapreduce.input.fileinputformat.split.minsize

By default:
mapreduce.input.fileinputformat.split.minsize < dfs.blocksize < ...maxsize
so if blosk size is 128 MB, input split size can be  recommended: 105MB (minsize) and 270MB (maxsize)
