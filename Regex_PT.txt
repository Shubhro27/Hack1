Regular expressions: <https://www.python-course.eu/re.php>

Syntax of regular expressions: r"<search string>", example, r"Cat", r"[A-Z]at" etc

the function used to search for a regular expression is search which resides in "re" module

example,
	import re
	x = re.search("cat","A cat and a rat can't be friends.")
	print x
	
	o/p: <_sre.SRE_Match object at 0x7fd4bf238238>
	
	x = re.search("cow","A cat and a rat can't be friends.")
	print x
	
	o/p: None

i.e. If a match has been possible, we get a so-called match object as a result, otherwise the value "None".

better example,
	>>> if re.search("cat","A cat and a rat can't be friends."):
	...     print "Some kind of cat has been found :-)"
	... else:
	...     print "No cat has been found :-("
	... 
	Some kind of cat has been found :-)
	>>> if re.search("cow","A cat and a rat can't be friends."):
	...     print "Cats and Rats and a cow."
	... else:
	...     print "No cow around."
	... 
	No cow around.
	
-----------------
Any character, done via metacharacter ".", 
example
r" .at "
this will search all the strings which,
a) end with "at" example, "rat", "cat", "bat", "eat", "sat".
b) have trailing and preceding spaces i.e. whole words. so it will ignore words like "education", "communicate", "falsification", "ramifications", "cattle".

disadvantage is that it will ignore "at" is strings like ""The cat, called Oscar, climbed on the roof." while the at should have been captured.
----------------
character classes, like any character from A-Z
this is defined by Square brackets, "[" and "]". 
example,
r"M[ae][iy]er"
this will cover four different spellings: Maier, Mayer, Meier, Meyer.

to cover a larger character classes eg, a class of letters between "a" and "e" or between "0" and "5", we use a a metacharacter "-".
example, [a-e] a simplified writing for [abcde] or [0-5] denotes [012345]. 

Another important example, "any lower case or uppercase letter" [A-Za-z]

Question. What character class is described by [-a-z]? 
Answer.   The character "-" and all the characters "a", "b", "c" all the way up to "z".

Uses of caret "^".
[^0-9] denotes the choice "any character but a digit". 
[^abc] means anything but an "a", "b" or "c" 
[a^bc] means an "a", "b", "c" or a "^"

example,
Python script, which finds all the lines of the phone book, which contain a person with the described surname (example , "Neu") and a first name starting with J.

import re
fh = open("simpsons_phone_book.txt")
for line in fh:
    if re.search(r"J.*Neu",line):
        print line.rstrip()
fh.close()

Predefined Character Classes:
character class, which describes a valid word character (i.e. all lower case and uppercase characters, all the digits and the underscore)
corresponding to the following regular expression: r"[a-zA-Z0-9_]"

the special sequences consist on:
