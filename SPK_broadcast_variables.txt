Broadcast variables:
if we have a spark cluster and 3 machines in the cluster
m1 = have some block of data of file1
m2 = have some block of data of file1
m3 = have some block of data of file1
driver = working on a separate machine m5
 
when we create RDD, data will be in RAM of each machine i.e. m1,m2,m3

if we want to do lookUp table or join,
all the data will be brought to one machine, the join will be performed and sent to driver 
i.e it will consume a lot of n/w bandwidth.

other way to do it is via a broadcast variable
i.e. we can create a Broadcast variable in driver and 
ask driver to read data (in m1,m2,m3) and create a hashMap which will have reference of data on each cluster machines,
the BV can be sent to all cluster machines where executer runs.
This will save bandwidth as we do not have to shuffle the data across cluster

NOTE: BV resides in driver and is pushed from driver to executer machines.

However, files being used for broadcast variables is preferred to be <= 64 mb coz larger files will degrade the performance.

BV features,
1) Broadcast variables are designed to be shared throughout a cluster and, 
	at the same time have to be able to fit in memory on one machine.
	
2) broadcast variables are immutable, so they cannot be changed later on (in case take a look at accumulators).
