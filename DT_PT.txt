Date and Time tutorial: https://www.guru99.com/date-time-and-datetime-classes-in-python.html

The datetime classes in Python are categorized into main 5 classes:
1) date – Manipulate just date ( Month, day, year). [from datetime import date]
2) time – Time independent of the day (Hour, minute, second, microsecond). [from datetime import time]
3) datetime – Combination of time and date (Month, day, year, hour, second, microsecond). [from datetime import datetime]
4) timedelta— A duration of time used for manipulating dates.
5) tzinfo— An abstract class for dealing with time zones.

[From datetime import date] implies "from the datetime module import the date class".

example,
	From datetime import date
	From datetime import time
	From datetime import datetime

	today = date.today()
	print "today date is ", today
	print "date components are ", today.day, today.month, today.year
	print "today's weekday# ", today.weekday()   ###################### Monday index is 0 and ..... Sunday index is 6
	
	o/p will be:
		today date is 2017-11-27
		date components are 11 27 2017
		today's weekday# 0       - snapshot has been taken on Monday.
	
example to use weekday(),
	From datetime import date
	From datetime import time
	From datetime import datetime
	
	wd = date.weekday(today)
	days = ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"]
	print "week day is number is : ", wd
	print "name of the day is : ", days[wd]

	o/p:
	week day is number is : 0
	name of the day is : Monday
	
datetime objects:
example-1,
	from datetime import datetime
	#
	today = datetime.today()
	print "date with datetime() format is - ",today

	o/p:
	date with datetime() format is - 2017-11-27 11:39:05:084000
	
example-2,
	from datetime import datetime
	from datetime import time
	#
	t = datetime.time(datetime.now())  #gives the current time.
	print "current time - ",t

	o/p:
	current time - 11:39:05:084000

	t = datetime.time(datetime.now())
	We will assigning it the current value of time using datetime.now()
	We are assigning the value of the current time to the variable t.
	
Formatting Time Output:
1) formatting a year: by using str-f-time function
		this functions uses control code for different date parameters i.e.
		[(%y/%Y – Year), (%a/%A- weekday), (%b/%B- month), (%d - day of month)] . 
		
	example, (to format year)
		import datetime as datetime
		#
		now = datetime.now()
		print now.strftime("%Y")  #will return the YEAR (4 digit)   
		print now.strftime("%y")  #will return the YEAR (last 2 digits)

		o/p,
		2017
		17
			
	example, (declare the date, day, month and year separately)
		import datetime as datetime
		#
		now = datetime.now()
		print now.strftime("%a:%d:%B:%y")       # %A would have returned day as "Tuesday"

		o/p,
		Tue:28:November:17.
 	
	example, (retrieve local system time, date or both with Strftime)
		import datetime as datetime
		#
		now = datetime.now()
		print now.strftime("%c")  #retrieves date and time
		print now.strftime("%x")  #retrieves date
		print now.strftime("%X")  #retrieves time
		
		o/p,
		11/28/2017 16:30:00
		11/28/2017
		16:30:00
		
	example, (retrieve time in format 12 hr and 24 hr)
		import datetime as datetime
		#
		now = datetime.now()
		print now.strftime("%I:%M:%S %p") # 12-Hour:Minute:Second:AM
		print now.strftime("%H:%M") # 24-Hour:Minute 
		
		O/p:
		04:30:00 PM
		16:30
		
Timedelta Objects:  it is a timespan to predict any "special/particular" day, date or time. it is USED TO CALCULATE about future or past.
	example, (calculate date 1 year after today's date)
	#	
	from datetime import date
	from datetime import time
	from datetime import datetime
	from datetime import timedelta
	#
	print timedelta(days=365,hours=8,minutes=15)
	print ("today is: " + str(datetime.now())
	print ("one year from now it will be: " + str(datetime.now() + timedelta (days=365))
	#
	print ("in 1 week and 4 days will be: " + str(datetime.now() + timedelta (weeks=1, days=4))
   
   o/p,
   365 days, 8:15:00
   today is: 2017-11-28 17:00:00.100000
   one year from now it will be: 2018-11-28 17:00:00.100000
   in 1 week and 4 days will be: 2017-12-5 17:00:00.100000
